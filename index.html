      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am from <a href="http://www.theirishstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Clare-map.gif">Clare</a> in the West of Ireland. 
        Growing up in a small town in Ireland, I always wanted to study and work in England. I moved to England to study a subject that not 
        only was I passionate about but a subject 
        that also fascinated me. I completed my bachelors and will soon be finishing my masters from the University of Essex.
      </p> 
 

   
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p> Studying for both my degrees has not only allowed me to develop my technical skills but also given me transferable key skills. 
        I really friendly and enjoy meeting new people so I also worked as a student ambassador, peer mentor and course representative. 
        I put myself out there and developed more valuable skills like: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Team Work</li>
        <li>Time management</li>
        <li>Organisation</li>
        <li>Programming Skills</li>
      </ul>
   
  
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p> Over the years, I have learnt many languages from university and also by using online resources. 
        I have 5 years of experience in Python, about 4 years in Java and 1 year in both C++ and C#. 
        I am currently now working on learning Ruby and R as these languages are widely been used recently. 
        As I enjoy web development, I also have about 2 years’ experience in JavaScript and technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. 
        I am also learning newer frameworks for web development some of which include angular and react in my own time as I feel 
        it’s quite important to stay up to date with the latest technologies and frameworks.</p>
      <p> I am currently a trainee for full stack developer and have experience in the following </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>Mangoose</li>
        <li>Semantic UI</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
     </ul>
